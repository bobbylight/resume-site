A simple site containing my resume.  Based on the excellent Pillar
theme from [3rdwavemdia](https://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/), but
tweaked to be minified and a couple of stylistic changes.

## Building

This actually starts a watch, building the minified site into `dist/`:
```bash
npm run build
```
